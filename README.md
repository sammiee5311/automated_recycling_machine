## Topic
Sustainable living in the New Normal

## Motivation
COVID-19 impacts on the recycling industry. Nowadays, a number of people order delivery food more than before due to the corona-virus. <br>

It is an important thing that people should recycle better for sustainable living. <br>

So weâ€™ve decided to build a machine that automatically sorts out recyclables and then gives rewards to people. <br>
